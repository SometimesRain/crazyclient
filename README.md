## About

CrazyClient was my private hacked client for an online MMORPG called Realm of the Mad God. It was first realized in late September, 2016. The client was publicly released in February, 2017. The reception was lukewarm at first but soon the download counts started picking up. The rising popularity of my little hobby project sent me to a development frenzy, resulting in me pumping out new features at an ever-increasing pace.

Developing CrazyClient taught me a multitude of new skills. It was the first project of mine to gain any real userbase. I learned, how certain features that I thought were self-evident, were found to be unintuitive by the users. How not asking for feedback yields better, more thought out feedback.

## My legacy

On 2017/03/10, CrazyClient became the first public client to feature a **sophisticated anti-death algorithm** (aka. OP autonexus). The hack works so well I actually received complaints from people wanting to kill their character for fame (an ingame currency earned by dying) but not being able to. **Nilly**, a well-known RotMG hack creator, had hinted at the possibility such hack [back in 2012](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=525417&p=6863054&viewfull=1#post6863054). He later explained the gist of it [here](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=525417&p=6876848&viewfull=1#post6876848).

**Death in RotMG is permanent**. That's the a foundational building block of the experience. Releasing a hack this powerful transformed the game, and the hacking scene.

Another big change came on 2017/10/26. This time I released a **map hack** for the game. There are 13 predefined realm maps, so I developed an algorithm for recognizing which map the player was on based on a small sample. Certain maps are better for earning fame and before the release of this hack people had manually tried to identify maps for hosting a **fame train**, an in-game phenomenon where lots of players organize in a selected realm for optimal fame gains.
